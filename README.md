volunteer work done for Blue Umbrella examining Twitter and Facebook data


This repository contains files related to volunteer work done in 2016 with [Blue Umbrella](https://www.blueumbrella.io/).

The goal was to download information over time from Twitter and Facebook related to autism in general, and autism solution apps in particular.

The pdf file contained in this repository is an example of a monthly report generated by aggregating the Twitter and Facebook data for the month.

R was used for the report generation and data download (R code will be uploaded after I locate the files).

Work was stopped after lack of interest in the report.  I do think that autism social communities can provide valuable insights for developers looking to created autism solutions (for example, see [this blog post](https://pando.com/2020/06/15/guide-unbundling-reddit/).
